# Data Based Vehicle Energy Consumption Modeling

* In this project, we have a real data set at hand which consists of various features regarding driving profiles of electric delivery trucks. The goal of this project is to investigate this data, and better understand some characteristics of electric vehicles as well as their energy consumption.

* This is a data analysis project. The students will

> 1.  Perform data cleaning and preprocessing
> 2.  Perform clustering to catch some patterns in the data
> 3.  Use concepts from machine learning for a detailed investigation of the data
> 4.  Perform visualization to present the outcomes of their investigation
